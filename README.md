# Papers-Please_Unity

We've created a game that is heavily inspired by "Papers Please" on Unity3D game engine for a game jam. Unfortunately, due to real-life problems we couldn't finish it on time.
Anyone who is interested can use it as a foundation for this type of a game project.

All of the 2D assets are our own work. Character portraits are created by emirshn.
